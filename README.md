Music Visualizer

To launch the visualizer:
1) change into the root directory and type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` into the command line.
2) Navigate to `localhost:` and the port number indicated by the command line (usually `8000`).

WARNING: Please close the browser window AND shut down the python HTTP server as soon as you are done playing with the music visualizer to avoid taking up too much of your computer's processor.

This project was built with little to no knowledge of how apps are actually created, so the browser will continuously `renderAnimationFrame` at 60/sec until the end of time.

Pretty straight forward as there is not much to this project.
